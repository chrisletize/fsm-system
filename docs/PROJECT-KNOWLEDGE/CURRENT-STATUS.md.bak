# FSM System - Current Status
*Last Updated: 2026-01-14*

## Project Overview
Building custom Field Service Management system to replace ServiceFusion.
- **Companies**: 4 service companies
- **Users**: ~25 field technicians, 5 office staff
- **Scale**: 250 jobs/day at peak season
- **Current Phase**: Phase 0 - Statement Generator

## Business Problem
ServiceFusion costs ~$1,500/month for 4 companies and lacks statement generation.
QuickBooks integration exists but we want to phase out QB entirely.
Michele (AR person) needs accurate customer statements quickly.

## Phase 0 Goals
Build standalone statement generator tool:
- Import unpaid invoices from ServiceFusion exports
- Generate professional PDF statements
- Clean web interface for Michele
- Deployment to production server

**Success Criteria**: Michele can generate statements in <2 minutes

## Current Sprint
Sprint 0.1: Setup & Data Import (Week 1)

## What's Working
✅ GitHub repository created
✅ Project board set up
✅ Directory structure created

## What's In Progress
🔄 Setting up development environment
🔄 Waiting for ServiceFusion data export

## Known Issues
None yet - just getting started!

## Next Steps
1. Export sample invoice data from ServiceFusion
2. Set up PostgreSQL database
3. Design database schema
4. Build data import script

# FSM System - Current Status
*Last Updated: 2026-01-15*

## Project Overview
Building custom Field Service Management system to replace ServiceFusion.
- **Companies**: 4 service companies (Get a Grip Charlotte, Kleanit Charlotte, CTS of Raleigh, Kleanit South Florida)
- **Users**: ~25 field technicians, 5 office staff
- **Scale**: 250 jobs/day at peak season
- **Current Phase**: Phase 0 - Statement Generator (Proof of Concept)

## Business Problem
ServiceFusion costs ~$1,500/month for 4 companies and lacks statement generation capability.
QuickBooks integration is problematic - requires Michele to spend 5-10 hours weekly fixing sync errors.
Michele (AR person) needs to generate professional customer statements monthly.

**Goal**: Build complete FSM replacement to eliminate ServiceFusion costs ($25k+/year savings) and gain full control over features.

## Phase 0 Goals (Statement Generator)
Build standalone statement generator as proof of concept:
- Import unpaid invoices from ServiceFusion Excel exports
- Generate professional PDF statements with company branding
- Clean web interface for Michele at statements.cletize.com
- Prove we can build production-quality business software

**Success Criteria**: Michele can generate statements in <2 minutes

## What's Working ✅
- PostgreSQL 16 database on ubuntu1
- Multi-tenant database schema (companies, customers, invoices)
- Real data imported: 180 invoices from Get a Grip Charlotte ($119,360 outstanding)
- Flask web application with burgundy/cream brand colors
- PDF statement generator with company logo and aging buckets
- Reverse proxy configured (statements.cletize.com via NPM)
- Web interface shows customer list, search, and one-click PDF generation

## What's In Progress 🔄
- Building Excel upload feature (so Michele can import fresh data monthly)
- Testing with other 3 companies' invoice data

## Known Issues
None currently - system stable

## Next Steps
1. Build upload page for Excel imports
2. Add duplicate detection logic (update existing invoices vs insert new)
3. Test with all 4 companies' data
4. Deploy to production and train Michele
5. Begin planning Phase 1 (full FSM features)

## Technical Stack Confirmed
- **Backend**: Python + Flask
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16
- **PDF Generation**: ReportLab
- **Frontend**: HTML + CSS (burgundy/cream brand colors)
- **Deployment**: Docker on ubuntu1, Nginx reverse proxy

## Key Metrics
- Development time so far: ~8 hours
- Database: 3 tables, 180 records
- Outstanding invoices tracked: $119,360
