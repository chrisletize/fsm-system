# Technical Decisions Log

## 2026-01-14: Version Control Platform
**Decision**: GitHub (cloud-hosted)
**Reasoning**: Free private repos, built-in Projects feature, industry standard, automatic backups
**Alternatives Considered**: Self-hosted GitLab
**Consequences**: Code lives on GitHub's servers, one less thing to maintain

## 2026-01-14: Project Organization
**Decision**: Use living documentation in PROJECT-KNOWLEDGE directory
**Reasoning**: Maintain context across multiple conversations, avoid token limits
**Alternatives Considered**: Keep everything in chat history
**Consequences**: 15 min overhead per sprint to update docs, but saves hours of re-explaining

## 2026-01-14: Development Approach
**Decision**: Start with Statement Generator proof of concept
**Reasoning**: Low risk, immediate value, proves we can build business software
**Alternatives Considered**: Jump straight to full FSM system
**Consequences**: 6 weeks before first production feature, but validates approach

## Technical Stack Decisions (Tentative - to be finalized)

### Backend
**Decision**: Python + FastAPI
**Reasoning**: Chris comfortable with Python, FastAPI is modern and fast
**Status**: To be confirmed in Sprint 0.1

### Database  
**Decision**: PostgreSQL
**Reasoning**: Mature, excellent JSON support, handles complex queries well
**Status**: To be confirmed in Sprint 0.1

### Frontend
**Decision**: React + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/ui
**Reasoning**: Modern, professional UI components, good developer experience
**Status**: To be confirmed in Sprint 0.3

### PDF Generation
**Decision**: TBD (ReportLab or WeasyPrint)
**Reasoning**: Need to evaluate during Sprint 0.2
**Status**: Research needed
# Technical Decisions Log

## 2026-01-14: Version Control Platform
**Decision**: GitHub (cloud-hosted)
**Reasoning**: Free private repos, built-in Projects feature, industry standard, automatic backups
**Alternatives Considered**: Self-hosted GitLab
**Consequences**: Code lives on GitHub's servers, one less thing to maintain

## 2026-01-14: Project Organization
**Decision**: Use living documentation in PROJECT-KNOWLEDGE directory
**Reasoning**: Maintain context across multiple conversations, avoid token limits
**Alternatives Considered**: Keep everything in chat history
**Consequences**: 15 min overhead per sprint to update docs, but saves hours of re-explaining
**Note**: Made repo public so Claude can read docs directly via GitHub URLs

## 2026-01-14: Development Approach
**Decision**: Start with Statement Generator proof of concept (Phase 0)
**Reasoning**: Low risk, immediate value to Michele, proves we can build business software
**Alternatives Considered**: Jump straight to full FSM system
**Consequences**: 6 weeks before first production feature, but validates entire approach

## 2026-01-15: Backend Framework
**Decision**: Flask (not FastAPI)
**Reasoning**: Simpler for Phase 0, less boilerplate, faster to prototype
**Alternatives Considered**: FastAPI (may switch in Phase 1 for full FSM)
**Consequences**: Less "modern" but adequate for statement generator, quicker development

## 2026-01-15: Database Schema
**Decision**: Multi-tenant design with company_id foreign keys
**Reasoning**: All 4 companies share one database, easier to manage
**Alternatives Considered**: Separate database per company
**Consequences**: Need to filter by company_id in all queries, but simplified deployment

## 2026-01-15: PDF Generation
**Decision**: ReportLab
**Reasoning**: Programmatic control over layout, professional output, Python native
**Alternatives Considered**: WeasyPrint (HTML to PDF)
**Consequences**: More code to write layouts, but pixel-perfect control

## 2026-01-15: Data Import Strategy
**Decision**: Two-phase approach
**Phase 0 (Current)**: Manual Excel upload monthly
- Michele exports unpaid invoices from ServiceFusion
- Uploads via web interface at statements.cletize.com
- Good enough for proof of concept
- No ongoing costs

**Final FSM System**: Real-time from FSM database
- Statement generator reads directly from main FSM database
- No uploads needed - data is already there
- This is how it works once we replace ServiceFusion entirely

**Reasoning**: Don't pay ServiceFusion $450/month for API access when we're replacing them anyway. Manual uploads work fine for monthly statements.
**Consequences**: Extra step for Michele in Phase 0, but eliminates need for SF API integration

## 2026-01-15: Branding
**Decision**: Use Get a Grip Resurfacing brand colors (burgundy #8B1538 and cream #F5F5DC)
**Reasoning**: Chris's primary company, professional appearance
**Alternatives Considered**: Generic blue/gray corporate colors
**Consequences**: Statements look like company documents, builds trust

## 2026-01-15: Deployment
**Decision**: Docker on ubuntu1 behind Nginx Proxy Manager
**Reasoning**: Already have infrastructure, easy to maintain
**Alternatives Considered**: Dedicated production server
**Consequences**: Development and production on same server (fine for Phase 0)
