# Build Log — September 2026

One dated entry per increment: what was built, migration number, commit hash, smoke
result, anything deferred. Companion to `FIELDKIT_BUILD_DIRECTIVE_2026-09.md`.

## 2026-09-18 — Stage 0

**What:** Read the directive and the decisions-for-review doc in full. Verified the
§0.2 "what actually exists today" table against the live repo and the four production
databases rather than taking it on faith:
- Full route inventory (`grep '^@app.route'` on `app.py`, 3,248 lines) confirms no
  invoice/dispatch/extraction/reports/estimates/sales-CRM/company-settings/tax-settings
  routes exist; billing is exactly the v1 page the table describes (customer list +
  billing-contact readiness + CSV export, no balances/aging/statements).
- Live row counts across all four DBs: `invoices` = 0 everywhere; `tax_rates` = 100 rows
  (GAG/KC/CTS) and 0 (Kleanit SF); `customer_compliance_portals` = 0 everywhere.
- Confirmed and resolved the CLAUDE.md users-table conflict (directive §1.1/§5.3,
  decision #63) — see `DECISIONS-MADE-DURING-BUILD.md` D-003 for the full finding.
  Corrected `CLAUDE.md`.
- Searched the server and git history for the missing
  `FIELDKIT_DECISION_payment-anchoring.md` (decision #64) — confirmed absent, no action
  needed since its content is already in the directive. See D-004.
- Rewrote `docs/PROJECT-KNOWLEDGE/CURRENT-STATUS.md` (was dated 2026-02-10, badly
  stale). See D-005.
- Set up a project-level Claude Code permission file so the §1.3 working protocol
  (migrate → restart → curl → smoke test → commit → push) doesn't need a manual
  approval on every single command. See D-002.
- Asked and got answers on the Stage-1 ASK items (FL tax, delinquent-age threshold,
  SF-import tax exclusion) — see D-001.

**Migration:** none.
**Commit:** (pending — CLAUDE.md, CURRENT-STATUS.md, DECISIONS-MADE-DURING-BUILD.md,
BUILD-LOG-2026-09.md, .gitignore).
**Smoke test:** n/a (no code changed yet).
**Deferred:** nothing from Stage 0. Proceeding to Stage 1, Increment 1.1.

## 2026-09-18 — Stage 1, Increment 1.1 — Effective-dated tax rates + `/settings/tax`

**What:**
- `tax_rates` versioned by whole row: added `effective_from`/`effective_to`, dropped
  `UNIQUE(county)` in favor of `UNIQUE(county, effective_from)`, added a covering index.
  Mecklenburg split into a closed 7.25% row (2000-01-01–2026-06-30, now inactive) and
  the open 8.25% row (2026-07-01–, active) — verified contiguous, no gap/overlap.
- New `company_settings` table (one row per DB, enforced by a partial unique index),
  seeded with `company_name` from the existing `COMPANY_BRANDING` dict and
  `tax_exempt_by_default = TRUE` for `kleanit_sf` only (per D-001). Every other field
  left NULL for Chris/Michele to fill in.
- `_compute_invoice_tax()` reworked to anchor on `invoice_date` via a new
  `_tax_rate_as_of()` helper, instead of "whatever's `is_active = TRUE` right now."
- New routes (admin only): `/settings/tax` (list, "active as of" + "show all"
  filters), `/settings/tax/new`, `/settings/tax/<id>/edit`, `/settings/tax/<id>/end`,
  `/settings/company`. Added to the Settings nav dropdown in `base.html`.
- Reused Brick #1 (suggest-don't-restrict autocomplete) for the county field —
  see D-007 for why not Brick #2.

**Migration:** 009 (`009_tax_effective_dates_and_company_settings.sql`), applied to all
four DBs. First attempt failed on all three NC DBs with a unique-constraint violation
(the historical INSERT ran before the existing row's `effective_from` was moved off
`2000-01-01`, so both rows briefly collided on `(county, effective_from)`); fixed by
reordering to UPDATE-then-INSERT and re-applied cleanly (idempotent — safe re-run
confirmed via `IF NOT EXISTS`/`NOTICE...skipping` on the already-migrated DBs).
Pre-migration `pg_dump` backups of all four DBs are in `~/db-backups/2026-09-18/`.

**Commit:** (pending — this entry, migration file, `app.py`, three new templates,
`base.html` nav, `tests/smoke_tax_settings.py`, decisions log).

**Smoke test:** `tests/smoke_tax_settings.py` — 14/14 checks pass (schema, Mecklenburg
row split, effective-date resolution on both sides of 2026-07-01, duplicate-constraint
rejection, company_settings singleton + seed values). Also manually exercised every
route (list/new/edit/end/company) via Flask's test client with a forged admin session:
caught and fixed one real bug this way (`r.effective_from > today` compared a `date`
against a `str` in the `show_all=1` branch of `tax_rates_list.html`, 500'd — fixed with
a `|string` filter). POST paths (create/edit/end a test rate, save company settings)
exercised against the live `fieldkit_getagrip` DB and cleaned up/reverted afterward.

**Deferred:** the "never edit a rate a hardened invoice used" guard is UX-only for now
(see D-006) — there's no invoice-to-rate linkage yet to enforce it against.

Proceeding to Increment 1.2 (receivable/version refactor).
